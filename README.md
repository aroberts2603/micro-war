This project is about a game my friends showed me which we call micro war.
It is meant to be played with pen and paper were a map is layed out with terrain.
The terrain is randomly generated and the map is on a grid system. Each team can create and move their units, of which there are several different types.
These units can be used to kill other units and take control of resources and the map.
The goal is to defeat the enemy team(s) to win the game. This online version is made in javascript and uses firebase as a backend for the database. Currently there is no way to make an account so if you want to try it out or help the project, email me at aroberts2603@gmail.com and I can add you into the database.
